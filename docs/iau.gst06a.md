# iauGst06a

```js
rv = IAU.gst06a(uta, utb, tta, ttb)
```

Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000 and 2006
resolutions).

## Given:
```
   uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
   tta,ttb    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
```

## Returned (function value):
```
              double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
```

## Notes:

1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
   Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
   argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
   any of these ways, among others:

```
          Part A        Part B

       2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
       2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
       2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
       2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
```

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
   in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
   between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
   method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
   rotation angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
   delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
   question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
   versa.

2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
   and TT to predict the effects of precession-nutation.  If UT1 is
   used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds
   result.

3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000/2006 resolutions and
   must be used only in conjunction with IAU 2006 precession and
   IAU 2000A nutation.

4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

## Called:
```
   iauPnm06a    classical NPB matrix, IAU 2006/2000A
   iauGst06     Greenwich apparent ST, IAU 2006, given NPB matrix
```
