# iauNut00b

```js
[dpsi, deps] = IAU.nut00b(date1, date2)
```

Nutation, IAU 2000B model.

## Given:
```
   date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
```

## Returned:
```
   dpsi,deps     double    nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
```

## Notes:

1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
   among others:

```
          date1          date2

       2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
       2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
       2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
       2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
```

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
   the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
   optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
   are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
   and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
   obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
   value of 84381.448 arcsec.  (The errors that result from using
   this function with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be
   neglected.)

   The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but
   includes also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-
   period planetary terms (Note 7).

3) This function is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
   nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
   2000.  The function computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar
   nutation series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated
   corrections for the precession rate adjustments and the offset
   between the GCRS and J2000.0 mean poles.

4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
   terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only
   77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
   results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
   accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
   suitable for most practical applications.

   The function delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
   (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside
   1 mas).  The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the
   function iauNut00a (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy
   at current dates;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
   corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
   (FCN) must also be included.

5) The present function provides classical nutation.  The
   MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
   with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
   adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
   precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
   and precession adjustments, are supported by the SOFA functions
   iauBi00  and iauPr00.

6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
   comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
   adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
   nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
   precession implementation, such as iauPmat76,  to deliver GCRS-
   to-true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However,
   for symmetry with the iauNut00a  function (q.v. for the reasons),
   the SOFA functions do not generate the "total nutations"
   directly.  Should they be required, they could of course easily
   be generated by calling iauBi00, iauPr00 and the present function
   and adding the results.

7) The IAU 2000B model includes "planetary bias" terms that are
   fixed in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The
   amplitudes quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely
   Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for
   the "total nutations" method described in Note 6.  The Luzum
   (2001) values used in this SOFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas
   and +0.388 mas, are optimized for the "rigorous" method, where
   frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in
   that order.  During the interval 1995-2050, the SOFA
   implementation delivers a maximum error of 1.001 mas (not
   including FCN).
