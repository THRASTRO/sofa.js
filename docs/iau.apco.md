parameters for transformations between ICRS and observed
coordinates.  The caller supplies the Earth ephemeris, the Earth
rotation information and the refraction constants as well as the
site coordinates.

```

## Notes:

1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
   convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
   JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
   others:

```
          date1          date2

       2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
       2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
       2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
       2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
```

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
   where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
   acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
   argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
   resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
   good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
   applications of this function the choice will not be at all
   critical.

   TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
   accuracy.

2) The vectors eb, eh, and all the astrom vectors, are with respect
   to BCRS axes.

3) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
   reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN
   CONVENTION:  the longitude required by the present function is
   right-handed, i.e. east-positive, in accordance with geographical
   convention.

4) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
   Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
   Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
   meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
   s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
   Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
   (especially) sp can be set to zero.

   Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
   local meridian.

5) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
   dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
   (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
   refraction.

6) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
   values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
   accordance with the models used.

7) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
   Ephemeris, the Earth rotation information and refraction
   constants, the function iauApco13 can be used instead of the
   present function.  This starts from UTC and weather readings etc.
   and computes suitable values using other SOFA functions.

8) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
   structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
   astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

   The various functions support different classes of observer and
   portions of the transformation chain:

```
        functions         observer        transformation

     iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
     iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
     iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
     iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
     iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
     iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
```

   Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
   compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
   supplied by the caller.

   The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
   parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
   comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
   observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
   aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
   transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

9) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
   iauAtioq, iauAtoiq, iauAtciq* and iauAticq*.
