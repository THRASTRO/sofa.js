Earth rotation angle, supplied by the caller explicitly.

## Notes:

1) This function exists to enable sidereal-tracking applications to
   avoid wasteful recomputation of the bulk of the astrometry
   parameters:  only the Earth rotation is updated.

2) For targets expressed as equinox based positions, such as
   classical geocentric apparent (RA,Dec), the supplied theta can be
   Greenwich apparent sidereal time rather than Earth rotation
   angle.

3) The function iauAper13 can be used instead of the present
   function, and starts from UT1 rather than ERA itself.

4) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
   structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
   astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

   The various functions support different classes of observer and
   portions of the transformation chain:

```
        functions         observer        transformation

     iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
     iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
     iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
     iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
     iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
     iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
```

   Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
   compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
   supplied by the caller.

   The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
   parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
   comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
   observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
   aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
   transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
