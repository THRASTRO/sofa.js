## Given:
```
   iy     int      UTC:  year (Notes 1 and 2)
   im     int            month (Note 2)
   id     int            day (Notes 2 and 3)
   fd     double         fraction of day (Note 4)
```

## Returned:
```
   deltat double   TAI minus UTC, seconds
```

## Returned (function value):
```
          int      status (Note 5):
                     1 = dubious year (Note 1)
                     0 = OK
                    -1 = bad year
                    -2 = bad month
                    -3 = bad day (Note 3)
                    -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
                    -5 = internal error (Note 5)
```

## Notes:

1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
   to call the function with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
   zero is returned together with a warning status.

   Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
   advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
   impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
   after the release year of the present function (see the constant
   IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is
   returned but the result is computed in the normal way.

   For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1.
   This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year
   so early that JD could not be computed.

2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
   the TAI-UTC value returned is for the period leading up to the
   leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
   second ends, the TAI-UTC returned is for the period following the
   leap second.

3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
   1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
   such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
   function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.

4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the
   introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the
   end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid
   range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status -4
   is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to zero is
   acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
   occurs only pre-1972).

5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
   errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
   month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, status -2 (bad month)
   will be returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a
   case that is impossible but causes some compilers to issue a
   warning.

6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.
