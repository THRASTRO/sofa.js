# iauPn06a

```js
[dpsi, deps, epsa, rb, rp, rbp, rn, rbpn] = IAU.pn06a(date1, date2)
```

Precession-nutation, IAU 2006/2000A models:  a multi-purpose function,
supporting classical (equinox-based) use directly and CIO-based use
indirectly.

## Given:
```
   date1,date2  double          TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
```

## Returned:
```
   dpsi,deps    double          nutation (Note 2)
   epsa         double          mean obliquity (Note 3)
   rb           double[3][3]    frame bias matrix (Note 4)
   rp           double[3][3]    precession matrix (Note 5)
   rbp          double[3][3]    bias-precession matrix (Note 6)
   rn           double[3][3]    nutation matrix (Note 7)
   rbpn         double[3][3]    GCRS-to-true matrix (Notes 8,9)
```

## Notes:

1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
    convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
    JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
    among others:

```
           date1          date2

        2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
        2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
        2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
        2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

    The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
    cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
    is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
    the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
    optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
    are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
```

2)  The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000A) in
    longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
    equinox and ecliptic of date.  Free core nutation is omitted;
    for the utmost accuracy, use the iauPn06 function, where the
    nutation components are caller-specified.

3)  The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2006 precession.

4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
    applying frame bias.

5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
    date by applying precession.

6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
    applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.

7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean of date to true of
    date by applying the nutation (luni-solar + planetary).

8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true of date
    (CIP/equinox).  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame bias,
    precession and nutation in that order.

9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2006/2000A Celestial
    Intermediate Pole are elements (3,1-3) of the GCRS-to-true
    matrix, i.e. rbpn[2][0-2].

10) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
    arguments.  The arrays are filled in the stated order.
