# eraGmst00

```js
rv = ERFA.gmst00(uta, utb, tta, ttb)
```

Greenwich mean sidereal time (model consistent with IAU 2000
resolutions).

## Given:
```
   uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
   tta,ttb    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
```

## Returned (function value):
```
              double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
```

## Notes:

1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
   Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
   argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
   any of these ways, among others:

```
          Part A         Part B

       2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
       2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
       2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
       2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
```

   The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
   cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
   is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
   in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
   between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
   method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
   Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
   delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
   question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
   versa.

2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
   and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
   both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.

3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
   used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
   components such as precession-nutation and equation of the
   equinoxes.

4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
   Conventions 2003.

## Called:
```
   eraEra00     Earth rotation angle, IAU 2000
   eraAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
```
