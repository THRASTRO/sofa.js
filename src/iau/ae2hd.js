**
**  Horizon to equatorial coordinates:  transform azimuth and altitude
**  to hour angle and declination.
**
**  Given:
**     az       double       azimuth
**     el       double       altitude (informally, elevation)
**     phi      double       site latitude
**
**  Returned:
**     ha       double       hour angle (local)
**     dec      double       declination
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  All the arguments are angles in radians.
**
**  2)  The sign convention for azimuth is north zero, east +pi/2.
**
**  3)  HA is returned in the range +/-pi.  Declination is returned in
**      the range +/-pi/2.
**
**  4)  The latitude phi is pi/2 minus the angle between the Earth's
**      rotation axis and the adopted zenith.  In many applications it
**      will be sufficient to use the published geodetic latitude of the
**      site.  In very precise (sub-arcsecond) applications, phi can be
**      corrected for polar motion.
**
**  5)  The azimuth az must be with respect to the rotational north pole,
**      as opposed to the ITRS pole, and an azimuth with respect to north
**      on a map of the Earth's surface will need to be adjusted for
**      polar motion if sub-arcsecond accuracy is required.
**
**  6)  Should the user wish to work with respect to the astronomical
**      zenith rather than the geodetic zenith, phi will need to be
**      adjusted for deflection of the vertical (often tens of
**      arcseconds), and the zero point of ha will also be affected.
**
**  7)  The transformation is the same as Ve = Ry(phi-pi/2)*Rz(pi)*Vh,
**      where Ve and Vh are lefthanded unit vectors in the (ha,dec) and
**      (az,el) systems respectively and Rz and Ry are rotations about
**      first the z-axis and then the y-axis.  (n.b. Rz(pi) simply
**      reverses the signs of the x and y components.)  For efficiency,
**      the algorithm is written out rather than calling other utility
**      functions.  For applications that require even greater
**      efficiency, additional savings are possible if constant terms
**      such as functions of latitude are computed once and for all.
**
**  8)  Again for efficiency, no range checking of arguments is carried
**      out.

 *
 *  The conversion is done by a custom hacked perl script.
 *  Automatically generates QUnit tests for all functions.

 *  Please read notice below, as all rights go to the Standards
 *  Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) Review Board of the International
 *  Astronomical Union, as far as applicable. There is no guarantee
 *  that the conversion is bug free and I give no warranty of
 *  usability or correctness whatsoever.
 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
