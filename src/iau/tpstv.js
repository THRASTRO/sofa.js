**
**  In the tangent plane projection, given the star's rectangular
**  coordinates and the direction cosines of the tangent point, solve
**  for the direction cosines of the star.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     xi,eta  double     rectangular coordinates of star image (Note 2)
**     v0      double[3]  tangent point's direction cosines
**
**  Returned:
**     v       double[3]  star's direction cosines
**
**  1) The tangent plane projection is also called the "gnomonic
**     projection" and the "central projection".
**
**  2) The eta axis points due north in the adopted coordinate system.
**     If the direction cosines represent observed (RA,Dec), the tangent
**     plane coordinates (xi,eta) are conventionally called the
**     "standard coordinates".  If the direction cosines are with
**     respect to a right-handed triad, (xi,eta) are also right-handed.
**     The units of (xi,eta) are, effectively, radians at the tangent
**     point.
**
**  3) The method used is to complete the star vector in the (xi,eta)
**     based triad and normalize it, then rotate the triad to put the
**     tangent point at the pole with the x-axis aligned to zero
**     longitude.  Writing (a0,b0) for the celestial spherical
**     coordinates of the tangent point, the sequence of rotations is
**     (b-pi/2) around the x-axis followed by (-a-pi/2) around the
**     z-axis.
**
**  4) If vector v0 is not of unit length, the returned vector v will
**     be wrong.
**
**  5) If vector v0 points at a pole, the returned vector v will be
**     based on the arbitrary assumption that the longitude coordinate
**     of the tangent point is zero.
**
**  6) This function is a member of the following set:
**
**         spherical      vector         solve for
**
**         iauTpxes      iauTpxev         xi,eta
**         iauTpsts    > iauTpstv <        star
**         iauTpors      iauTporv         origin

 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
