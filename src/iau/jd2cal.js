function iauJd2cal(dj1, dj2)
/*
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**   i a u J d 2 c a l
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**
**  Julian Date to Gregorian year, month, day, and fraction of a day.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     dj1,dj2   double   Julian Date (Notes 1, 2)
**
**  Returned (arguments):
**     iy        int      year
**     im        int      month
**     id        int      day
**     fd        double   fraction of day
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int      status:
**                           0 = OK
**                          -1 = unacceptable date (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The earliest valid date is -68569.5 (-4900 March 1).  The
**     largest value accepted is 1e9.
**
**  2) The Julian Date is apportioned in any convenient way between
**     the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could
**     be expressed in any of these ways, among others:
**
**            dj1             dj2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "proleptic Gregorian
**     calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
**     the Gregorian calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
**     observed.
