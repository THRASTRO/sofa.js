**
**  Form the matrix of polar motion for a given date, IAU 2000.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     xp,yp    double    coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 1)
**     sp       double    the TIO locator s' (radians, Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rpom     double[3][3]   polar-motion matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  2) The argument sp is the TIO locator s', in radians, which
**     positions the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin on the equator.  It
**     is obtained from polar motion observations by numerical
**     integration, and so is in essence unpredictable.  However, it is
**     dominated by a secular drift of about 47 microarcseconds per
**     century, and so can be taken into account by using s' = -47*t,
**     where t is centuries since J2000.0.  The function iauSp00
**     implements this approximation.
**
**  3) The matrix operates in the sense V(TRS) = rpom * V(CIP), meaning
**     that it is the final rotation when computing the pointing
**     direction to a celestial source.
**
**  Called:
**     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     iauRy        rotate around Y-axis
**     iauRx        rotate around X-axis

 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
