**
**  Multiply a pv-vector by the transpose of an r-matrix.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  vector/matrix support function.
**
**  Given:
**     r        double[3][3]    r-matrix
**     pv       double[2][3]    pv-vector

**  Note:
**     It is permissible for pv and trpv to be the same array.
**
**  Called:
**     iauTr        transpose r-matrix
**     iauRxpv      product of r-matrix and pv-vector

 *  The conversion is done by a custom hacked perl script.

 *  Astronomical Union, as far as applicable. There is no guarantee
 *  that the conversion is bug free and I give no warranty of
 *  usability or correctness whatsoever.
 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
