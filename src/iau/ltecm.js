**
**  ICRS equatorial to ecliptic rotation matrix, long-term.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     epj     double         Julian epoch (TT)
**
**  Returned:
**     rm      double[3][3]   ICRS to ecliptic rotation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The matrix is in the sense
**
**        E_ep = rm x P_ICRS,
**
**     where P_ICRS is a vector with respect to ICRS right ascension
**     and declination axes and E_ep is the same vector with respect to
**     the (inertial) ecliptic and equinox of epoch epj.
**
**  2) P_ICRS is a free vector, merely a direction, typically of unit
**     magnitude, and not bound to any particular spatial origin, such
**     as the Earth, Sun or SSB.  No assumptions are made about whether
**     it represents starlight and embodies astrometric effects such as
**     parallax or aberration.  The transformation is approximately that
**     between mean J2000.0 right ascension and declination and ecliptic
**     longitude and latitude, with only frame bias (always less than
**     25 mas) to disturb this classical picture.
**
**  3) The Vondrak et al. (2011, 2012) 400 millennia precession model
**     agrees with the IAU 2006 precession at J2000.0 and stays within
**     100 microarcseconds during the 20th and 21st centuries.  It is
**     accurate to a few arcseconds throughout the historical period,
**     worsening to a few tenths of a degree at the end of the
**     +/- 200,000 year time span.
**
**  Called:
**     iauLtpequ    equator pole, long term
**     iauLtpecl    ecliptic pole, long term
**     iauPxp       vector product
**     iauPn        normalize vector

 *
 *  The conversion is done by a custom hacked perl script.
 *  Automatically generates QUnit tests for all functions.

 *  Please read notice below, as all rights go to the Standards

 *  usability or correctness whatsoever.
 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
