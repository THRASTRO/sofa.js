function iauGd2gce( a, f, elong, phi, height)
/*
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**   i a u G d 2 g c e
**  - - - - - - - - - -
**
**  Transform geodetic coordinates to geocentric for a reference
**  ellipsoid of specified form.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     a       double     equatorial radius (Notes 1,4)
**     f       double     flattening (Notes 2,4)
**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 4)
**     height  double     height above ellipsoid (geodetic, Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned:
**     xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**             int        status:  0 = OK
**                                -1 = illegal case (Note 4)
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The equatorial radius, a, can be in any units, but meters is
**     the conventional choice.
**
**  2) The flattening, f, is (for the Earth) a value around 0.00335,
**     i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  3) The equatorial radius, a, and the height, height, must be
**     given in the same units, and determine the units of the
**     returned geocentric vector, xyz.
**
**  4) No validation is performed on individual arguments.  The error
**     status -1 protects against (unrealistic) cases that would lead
**     to arithmetic exceptions.  If an error occurs, xyz is unchanged.
**
**  5) The inverse transformation is performed in the function
**     iauGc2gde.
**
**  6) The transformation for a standard ellipsoid (such as WGS84) can
**     more conveniently be performed by calling iauGd2gc,  which uses a
**     numerical code to identify the required a and f values.

 *  IAU SOFA functions converted to JS
 *  http:://www.github.com/mgreter/sofa.js
 *  2016 by Marcel Greter
 *
 *  The conversion is done by a custom hacked perl script.
 *  Automatically generates QUnit tests for all functions.
 *
 *  Please read notice below, as all rights go to the Standards
 *  Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) Review Board of the International
 *  Astronomical Union, as far as applicable. There is no guarantee
 *  that the conversion is bug free and I give no warranty of
 *  usability or correctness whatsoever.
 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
