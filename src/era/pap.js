function eraPap(a, b)
/*

**
**  Position-angle from two p-vectors.
**
**  Given:
**     a      double[3]  direction of reference point
**     b      double[3]  direction of point whose PA is required
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            double     position angle of b with respect to a (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The result is the position angle, in radians, of direction b with
**     respect to direction a.  It is in the range -pi to +pi.  The
**     sense is such that if b is a small distance "north" of a the
**     position angle is approximately zero, and if b is a small
**     distance "east" of a the position angle is approximately +pi/2.
**
**  2) The vectors a and b need not be of unit length.
**
**  3) Zero is returned if the two directions are the same or if either
**     vector is null.
**
**  4) If vector a is at a pole, the result is ill-defined.
**
**  Called:
**     eraPn        decompose p-vector into modulus and direction
**     eraPm        modulus of p-vector
**     eraPxp       vector product of two p-vectors
**     eraPmp       p-vector minus p-vector
**     eraPdp       scalar product of two p-vectors
