**
**  Form the matrix of nutation for a given date, IAU 2000A model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double          TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     rmatn        double[3][3]    nutation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean), where
**     the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true equatorial triad
**     of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with respect to the mean
**     equatorial triad of date.
**
**  3) A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas), can be
**     obtained by using instead the eraNum00b function.
