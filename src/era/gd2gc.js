**
**  Transform geodetic coordinates to geocentric using the specified
**  reference ellipsoid.
**
**  Given:
**     n       int        ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 3)
**     height  double     height above ellipsoid (geodetic, Notes 2,3)
**
**  Returned:
**     xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**             int        status:  0 = OK
**                                -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**                                -2 = illegal case (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     ERFA_WGS84
**        2     ERFA_GRS80
**        3     ERFA_WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the ERFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols ERFA_WGS84 etc. are defined in erfam.h.
**
**  2) The height (height, given) and the geocentric vector (xyz,
**     returned) are in meters.
**
**  3) No validation is performed on the arguments elong, phi and
**     height.  An error status -1 means that the identifier n is
**     illegal.  An error status -2 protects against cases that would
**     lead to arithmetic exceptions.  In all error cases, xyz is set
**     to zeros.
**
**  4) The inverse transformation is performed in the function eraGc2gd.
**
**  Called:
**     eraEform     Earth reference ellipsoids
**     eraGd2gce    geodetic to geocentric transformation, general
**     eraZp        zero p-vector
