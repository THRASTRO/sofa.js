function eraRm2v(r)
/*
**  - - - - - - - -
**   e r a R m 2 v
**  - - - - - - - -
**
**  Express an r-matrix as an r-vector.
**
**  Given:
**     r        double[3][3]    rotation matrix
**
**  Returned:
**     w        double[3]       rotation vector (Note 1)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) A rotation matrix describes a rotation through some angle about
**     some arbitrary axis called the Euler axis.  The "rotation vector"
**     returned by this function has the same direction as the Euler axis,
**     and its magnitude is the angle in radians.  (The magnitude and
**     direction can be separated by means of the function eraPn.)
**
**  2) If r is null, so is the result.  If r is not a rotation matrix
**     the result is undefined;  r must be proper (i.e. have a positive
**     determinant) and real orthogonal (inverse = transpose).
**
**  3) The reference frame rotates clockwise as seen looking along
**     the rotation vector from the origin.
