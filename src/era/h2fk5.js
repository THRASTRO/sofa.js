**
**  Transform Hipparcos star data into the FK5 (J2000.0) system.
**
**  Given (all Hipparcos, epoch J2000.0):
**     rh      double    RA (radians)
**     dh      double    Dec (radians)
**     drh     double    proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     ddh     double    proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     pxh     double    parallax (arcsec)
**     rvh     double    radial velocity (km/s, positive = receding)
**
**  Returned (all FK5, equinox J2000.0, epoch J2000.0):
**     r5      double    RA (radians)
**     d5      double    Dec (radians)
**     dr5     double    proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     dd5     double    proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     px5     double    parallax (arcsec)
**     rv5     double    radial velocity (km/s, positive = receding)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function transforms Hipparcos star positions and proper
**     motions into FK5 J2000.0.
**
**  2) The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
**     cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
**     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalog are not
**     taken into account.
**
**  4) See also eraFk52h, eraFk5hz, eraHfk5z.
