**
**  Earth reference ellipsoids.
**
**  Given:
**     n    int         ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     a    double      equatorial radius (meters, Note 2)
**     f    double      flattening (Note 2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**          int         status:  0 = OK
**                              -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     ERFA_WGS84
**        2     ERFA_GRS80
**        3     ERFA_WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the ERFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols ERFA_WGS84 etc. are defined in erfam.h.
**
**  2) The ellipsoid parameters are returned in the form of equatorial
**     radius in meters (a) and flattening (f).  The latter is a number
**     around 0.00335, i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  3) For the case where an unsupported n value is supplied, zero a and
**     f are returned, as well as error status.

 *  IAU SOFA functions converted to JS
 *  http:://www.github.com/mgreter/sofa.js
 *  2016 by Marcel Greter
 *
 *  The conversion is done by a custom hacked perl script.
 *  Automatically generates QUnit tests for all functions.
 *
 *  Please read notice below, as all rights go to the Standards
 *  Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) Review Board of the International
 *  Astronomical Union, as far as applicable. There is no guarantee
 *  that the conversion is bug free and I give no warranty of
 *  usability or correctness whatsoever.
 *
 *  The agreement below (3c/d) says that functions should
 *  be renamed. From the preface I guess this only applies
 *  if the function behavior was changed in any way. Since
 *  this is a one-to-one conversion, it shouldn't apply?
