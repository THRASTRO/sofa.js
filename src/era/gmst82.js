**
**  Universal Time to Greenwich mean sidereal time (IAU 1982 model).
**
**  Given:
**     dj1,dj2    double    UT1 Julian Date (see note)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date dj1+dj2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example,
**     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             dj1            dj2
**
**         2450123.7          0          (JD method)
**          2451545        -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5         0.2         (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
**     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at
**     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the dj1 argument is for
**     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the dj2 argument lies in the
**     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is
**     always described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it
**     gives the difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady
**     4-minutes-per-day drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When
**     whole days are ignored, the expression happens to equal the GMST
**     at 0 hours UT1 each day.
**
**  3) In this function, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments
**     dj1 and dj2) is used directly as the argument for the standard
**     formula, the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to
**     take account of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then
**     added, but omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.
**

**     eraAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
